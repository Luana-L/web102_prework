## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
1. I wasn't extremely familiar with some of the JavaScript functions that were introduced, but the tutorial was very clear and the examples were very helpful in quickly catching me up to speed!
2. I had some difficulties getting my optional "Our Games" link in the navbar to right-align because it was inside the header flex box. However, I eventually figured it out after a quick google search helped me figure out the correct CSS styling elements to add to make just one element in a flex box be right-aligned.
